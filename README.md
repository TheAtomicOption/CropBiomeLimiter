Development TODO list:

- Automatically add all crops from other mods to the medium/lush biome by default so they aren't just universally blocked.

- Add system for custom biome types. This will probably be temperature and rainfall based.

- Improve default configs to include settings for popular mods like Pam's Harvestcraft and Biomes'o'Plenty
